# 🍹🍺 The Thirsty Python Bar 🥃🍸

Welcome to **The Thirsty Python Bar**! 🍻 This terminal-based drink ordering simulator allows you to simulate your experience at a bar, all through a Command-Line Interface (CLI) powered by Python. Whether it's your birthday or you're just looking to grab a drink, this project offers an interactive way to place drink orders, manage customer tabs, and celebrate special occasions — all while keeping track of orders with an SQL database.

- 🥳 **Birthday Fun**: Celebrate your birthday and automatically update your age when you do.  
- 🍹 **Drink Management**: Add, remove, and select drinks from the menu.  
- 💳 **Tabs**: Track the drinks a customer has ordered. Open a new tab, view previous orders, and switch between tabs.

- 💾 **SQL Backend**: The system uses an SQL database to store, update, and retrieve customer and drink data.
